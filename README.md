## Introduction

A dice roller which I've actually used on a few occasions when away from home without dice.

Offer a useful alternative for when you've lost your dice but have a D&D session about to start!

Practice, improve and demonstrate what I can do with fundamental coding languages.

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript/jQuery

## Launch

Running this project locally should be nice and easy!

### Prerequisites: None

### Running: Once you've downloaded and unzipped the repo file, simply open up the index.html in your browser.

## Author Notes

### Why D&D?
Aside from it being a fun hobby, I saw a lot of potential for D&D as something I could develop coding projects around. With so much information and variables, the possibilities are seemingly endless for what I can create as my knowledge improves.
